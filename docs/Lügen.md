## Overview

- **`validate_claim`**: Checks if the declared card value matches the placed cards. - NO
- **`transfer_cards`**: Assigns cards to respective players. - NO

## Game State Management
The game manages its state using a `game` object containing:

- **`state`**: Stores the current game status, placed cards, and player order.
- **`players`**: Stores player information, card counts, and the current turn.

---

## Alternative Game Modes
There are two game modes:

1. **Classic Mode (`"classic"`)**:  
   - Four aces immediately end the game. The player with four aces loses.
   - The game ends when only two players remain.
   - A player wins when they have no more cards.

2. **Alternative Mode (`"alternative"`)**:  
   - Aces are treated like normal cards.
   - The game proceeds as usual, but aces have no special role.

At the start of the game, one of the two modes is selected:
```json
{"$or": [{"game_mode": "classic"}, {"game_mode": "alternative"}]}
```
